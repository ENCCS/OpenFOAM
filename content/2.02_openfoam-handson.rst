MotorBike Case
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This case uses OpenFOAM to calculate the steady flow around a motorcycle and rider, see
the Figure.

- As OpenFOAM cases are not backward compatible, always copy cases from *$FOAM_TUTORIALS* of current version

.. code:: bash

 $ module add openfoam/1912
 $ echo $FOAM_BASHRC
 /pdc/vol/openfoam/v1912/OpenFOAM-v1912/etc/bashrc
 $ source $FOAM_BASHRC
 $ cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS/incompressible/simpleFoam/motorBike .

- The structure of the case is shown in the following

.. code:: bash

 $ cd motorBike
 $ ls
 0.orig Allclean Allrun constant system

 $ tree -d 1 .

- The default setting is to run the application simpleFoam on 6 MPI-rank with block
size of (20×8×8). The results are stored in 5 time steps 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500.
The workflow is following


Run the case
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

 $ source $FOAM_BASHRC
 $ ./Allrun # run the workflow


Modification
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- For the scalability tests, the default mesh of 35 k cells is small, we need to increase the block mesh size. We can change the settings in file *system/blockMeshDict*, for example, from

.. code:: bash

 blocks
 (
 hex (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) (20 8 8) simpleGrading (1 1 1)
 );

to

.. code:: bash

 blocks
 (
 hex (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) (200 80 80) simpleGrading (1 1 1)
 );

i.e. the mesh size in x, y, and z directories increases 10 times.

- Also we can change the MPI rank and the decomposition method in file *system/decomposeParDict*, for example, change the default

.. code:: bash

 numberOfSubdomains 6;
 method hierarchical;

to

.. code:: bash

 numberOfSubdomains 24; #// MPI-rank
 method hierarchical;

(Note: If you still used “method hierarchical”, the hierarchicalCoeffs in the file
should be coordinately changed)

.. code:: bash

 hierarchicalCoeffs
 {
 n (4 3 2); // 4x3x2 = 24 !!
 ...

The script *Allclean* can be used to delete the log files and remove the results from
motorBike run and then rerun again.

Validating the model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make sure everything is OK we can the output logs from the OpenFOAM run,
this will show if the run actually worked or not. For each stage there is a log.[stage]
output. For example, in the *log.simpleFoam* file the coefficients should be likes

.. code:: bash

 $ tail -n 50 ./log.simpleFoam
 ...
 Time = 500
 ...
 ExecutionTime = 279.99 s ClockTime = 281 s
 ...
